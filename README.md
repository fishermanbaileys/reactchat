<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a simple easy to use web chatroom created using React.js, Node.js, and Firebase. This project was finished by a two-person team over the course of a couple of days.

After completing the core elements of the chatroom we built and implemented the following features/functions:
* Two sign-in options:
  * Google sign in provider
  * Email and password (custom credetials)
* Sign up function for creating an account with a custom email and password.
  * This function includes custom regex validation to ensure the credentials meet our security standards.
* Account recovery via email if a user forgets their password.
* An emoji selector button that allows the user to insert an emoji at the cursor's location.
* Backend security rules to protect user credentials, prevent excessive database use, and ban unfriendly users.
* Router setup for page navigation based on login status and button usage.

All of this is encapsulated into a clean, consistent styling with intentional buttons and an intuitive layout.
